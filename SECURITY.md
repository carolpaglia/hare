## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

If you find a vulnerability, feel free to open an issue or create a pull 
request with the fix. Or contact me on my [email](mailto:leonardoaugusto287@gmail.com)!
